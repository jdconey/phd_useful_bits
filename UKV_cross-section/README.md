# Plotter for a cross section of UKV data.

Running this code:
Hopefully you've got conda and jupyter notebooks installed.

The `environment.yaml` file contains all the packages within my conda environment to get this code running in a Jupyter notebook.

Run that, make a new environment and having activated the new environment, launch notebooks, possibly using `jupyter notebook` in the terminal.


YMMV etc
